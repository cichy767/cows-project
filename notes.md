# Think about the scalability of your solution. What would happen if your system would handle not only this farm, but all farms in Europe?
1. Database Scalability
* Sharding: Split the database by geographical regions or by farm to distribute the load and improve performance.
* Replication: Use read replicas to distribute read queries and reduce the load on the primary database.
* Optimization: Ensure indexes and query optimizations are in place to handle large volumes of data.
2. Microservices Architecture
* Service Separation: Separate different functionalities (e.g., animal management, feed management) into microservices.
* Independent Scaling: Allow each microservice to scale independently based on its load and requirements.
3. Load Balancing
* Distribute Requests: Use load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
4. Caching
* Reduce Load: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
5. Asynchronous Processing
* Background Tasks: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) and background workers (e.g., Celery) for processing tasks asynchronously.
6. API Rate Limiting
* Control Access: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across different farms.
7. Monitoring and Logging
* Track Performance: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track system performance and detect issues.
8. Infrastructure as Code
* Automate Deployments: Use tools like Terraform to automate infrastructure management and deployments.
9. Data Privacy and Security
* Compliance: Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
* Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
10. Scalable Deployment
* Kubernetes: Use Kubernetes to manage containerized applications, ensuring easy scaling and management.
* Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling to automatically adjust the number of running instances based on load.

# Think of which storage layer you would use to perform analytics on changing attributes over time.

**Time-Series Databases:**
* TimescaleDB: An extension of PostgreSQL, combining relational database capabilities with time-series data management, allowing for complex queries and analytics.

**Data Warehousing Solutions**
* Google BigQuery: A serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse designed for business agility. 
It supports SQL queries and integrates with various analytics tools.

**Data Lakes**
* Azure Data Lake Storage: A highly scalable and secure data lake that supports high-performance analytics workloads. Integrates with Azure analytics services.

**Stream Processing**
* Apache Kafka with ksqlDB: Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can handle real-time data feeds. ksqlDB allows you to run continuous, interactive SQL queries against Kafka streams.
